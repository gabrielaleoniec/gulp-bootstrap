Welcome to my favourite basic Gulp configuration
==================================================

Gulp file along with package.json containing my basic favourite configuration

What's Here
-----------

* README.md - this file
* eslintrc.json - this file contains the configuration for the ES linter - be careful, it's for AirBnB and **ES5**
* gulpfile.js - this file contains the sample Gulp configuration
* package.json - list of packages to contain for Gulp + *sass linter*, which is not a Gulp package, but is extremely useful
